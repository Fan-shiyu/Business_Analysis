# CNX Case Study – Improving Customer Experience at TelCo Inc.

This project looks at customer service data from TelCo Inc., a telecom company dealing with low customer satisfaction and a high number of support calls.

## What’s the Goal?

TelCo Inc. wanted help figuring out:
- Why are customers unhappy?
- Why are so many people calling back?
- How does the support experience affect how people see the brand?

My job was to dig into the data, find patterns, and share clear recommendations to make things better — all in a way that’s easy for the leadership team to understand.

## What You’ll Find Here

- A presentation with key findings, pain points, and improvement ideas  
- Python code used to clean the data, run analysis, and create visuals  
- Data from customer surveys, support interactions, and internal metrics

## A Few Key Takeaways

- Billing and refund issues are a big reason for customer frustration  
- Many customers don’t use self-service tools, even when they could  
- Experienced advisors make a big difference in customer satisfaction  
- A better support experience leads to a stronger brand image
